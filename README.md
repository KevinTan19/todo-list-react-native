Used Tech Stack :
- Async Storage : using @react-native-async-storage/async-storage because it was simplest async storage just like using localStorage on web
- Styling : I have a personal reason for using React Native StyleSheet: it's been a while since I've updated my knowledge on the React Native tech stack. I've heard about React Native Paper, but I haven't mastered that library yet. Therefore, I opted for the quickest method available. However, if I have more time, I will definitely switch to a more proper library.
